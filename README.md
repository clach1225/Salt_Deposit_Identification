This is Christopher Lach's Repo for the Kaggle TGS Salt Identification Challenge. The repo was created to fulfilment of my Practicum 2 Project at Regis Univerisity in Denver, CO. This project is my final step in completing my studies at Regis.

The Project consisted of properly classifing individual pixels of seismic images as 0 (sediment/black) or 1 (salt/white). The data was downloaded from Kaggle, which you can find using this link: Project Source.
